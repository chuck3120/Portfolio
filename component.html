          <p>I'm Chuck, a software engineer</p>
        </div>
        <p>I have over six years of experience in the fire industry and am now seeking new challenges.</p>
        <p> I decided to start a new career in
          game development.</p>
        <p>I began studying on my own and developed games using the Unity engine.</p>
        <p>After two weeks, I uploaded my first game, Galaxy Defender to
          <a href="https://chuck3120.itch.io/eggs-galaxy-defender" class="io">itch.io.</a>
        </p>
        <p>I primarily use C# but also work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future, I hope to create great
          software that helps improve people's lives.</p>
